# Mars Rover Simulation

All the Java code files in `/src` belongs to different aspects of Mars Rover Simulation like Move, Turn Left, Turn Right etc,. For a pre-determined input commands, execute the `MarsRoverSimulation.java` file which has the main function. For user's choice based input, execute the `MarsRoverUser.java` file which has the main function and other supported functions to get the user input. 

The commands that controls the rover are as follows :

- M - Move
- R - Turn Right
- L - Turn Left
- S - Stop (This command is only for `MarsRoverUser.java`)

This simulation follows OOPs principles and SOLID principles.

This implementation provides a flexible and extensible solution for the Mars Rover simulation. It can be easily expanded to include new commands or grid components without modifying the existing code.
